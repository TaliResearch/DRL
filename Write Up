Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. 
It does not require a model of the environment and can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without 
requiring adaptations. Combining this with deep learning gives us the DQN (Deep Q Network) algorithm. 

There are 5 essential pieces to the framework model:
1.	Data Preparation
2.	Environment Setup
3.	Deep Reinforcement Learning Model
4.	Agent Training
5.	Evaluation

1.	Data Preparation:
•	Obtain historical price data for the asset class of our investment universe -eg. US equities. 
• As a simple starting point we can use libraries like pandas or yfinance to fetch the data from online sources.
•	Preprocess the data by calculating technical indicators - common popular examples include moving averages, 
  relative strength index (RSI), or other features. These features are not limited to technical trading indicators 
  such as these examples - we can use fundamental indicators or more exotic inputs for training. But keep in mind
  the more quantifiable inputs provide clearer and cleaner signal-noise ratios - enhancing algorithm performance
  (Garbage in-Garbage out is very relevant when it comes to data quality here) 
•	Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. (We can also apply cross validation depending 
  on the complexity we are considering in the model - cross-validation is a resampling method that uses 
  different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations.)

2.	Environment Setup:
•	Define an environment class that represents the trading environment. This includes methods like reset, 
  step, and get_state to handle the interaction between the agent and the environment.
•	The reset method initializes the environment at the beginning of each episode, 
  setting the initial state and any other necessary variables.
•	The step method takes an action from the agent, updates the environment state, calculates the reward,
  and returns the new state, reward (whether the episode is finished or not - careful). 
•	The get_state method returns the current state of the environment.

3.	Deep Reinforcement Learning Model: DQN 
•	We apply a deep learning library, in this case tensorflow, another choice is pytorch,
  to define a deep Q-network (DQN) model.
•	The model takes the state variables data as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action.
•	We train the model using the historical data and the deep Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm.

4.	Agent Training:
•	Initialisation of the DQN model.
•	Implementation of an agent class that interacts with the environment and the model.
•	Applying an an exploration-exploitation strategy, most popular as we have applied here is epsilon-greedy, 
  - this balances exploration of new actions and exploitation of learned actions.
•	Start the training loop:
    •	Resets the environment.
    •	Gets the current state from the environment.
    •	Chooses an action using the exploration-exploitation strategy.
    •	Takes the chosen action in the environment and observes the next state, 
    reward, and episode termination.
    •	Stores the experience tuple (state, action, reward, next_state, done) in a replay buffer.
    •	Samples a batch of experiences from the replay buffer.
    •	Updates the DQN model using the sampled experiences.
    •	Repeats the above steps until convergence or a predefined number of episodes.

5.	Evaluation:  Testing
•	After training, we use the trained model to make trading decisions in a simulated 
  environment using the testing set.
•	We evaluate the performance of our strategy by calculating core performance metrics 
  like profit and loss, Sharpe ratio, and can add in other relevant measures 
  such as Calman ratio and Sortino ratio. 

A Note of Caution:
Deep reinforcement learning for trading as a real world strategy is a far more complex task - 
there are many additional considerations to take into account
when it comes to trading and investing in the real market with real capital - 
such as risk management, transaction costs, and the choice of hyperparameters. 
This framework provides a starting point, from which we can further enhance it based on the 
specific needs of the investor constraints, the asset class, the risk mandate and more..
